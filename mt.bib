This research proposes a language independent sentence alignment approach based on Polish (not position-sensitive language) to {English} experiments. This alignment approach was developed on the TED Talks corpus, but can be used for any text domain or language pair. The proposed approach implements various heuristics for sentence recognition. Some of them value synonyms and semantic text structure analysis as a part of additional information. Minimization of data loss was ensured. The solution is compared to other sentence alignment implementations. Also an improvement in {MT} system score with text processed with described tool is shown. "

While excellent translation systems exist for many popular languages, it is fair to say that the development of such systems for Polish and {English} has been neglected. The most popular methodologies are not well suited for the Polish language and require adaptation. Polish language resources are lacking in parallel and monolingual data. Therefore, the main objective of the present study was to develop an automatic and robust Polish to {English} translation system to meet specific translation requirements and to develop bilingual textual resources by mining comparable corpora. Experiments were conducted mostly on casual human speech, consisting of lectures, movie subtitles, European Parliament proceedings, and European Medicines Agency. The aims were to rigorously analyze the various problems and to improve the quality of baseline systems, i.e., adaptation of techniques and training parameters to increase the Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score for maximum performance.

Parallel dictionaries constructed by humans are a widely available resource, but they are limited and do not provide enough coverage for good quality translation purposes, due to out-of-vocabulary words and neologisms. This motivates the use of statistical translation systems, which are unfortunately dependent on the quantity and quality of training data. Such has a very limited availability especially for some languages and very narrow text domains. Is this research we present our improvements to Yalign's mining methodology by reimplementing the comparison algorithm, introducing a tuning scripts and by improving performance using GPU computing acceleration. The experiments are conducted on various text domains and bi-data is extracted from the Wikipedia dumps. "

abstract = "Abstract The quality of machine translation is rapidly evolving. Today one can find several machine translation systems on the web that provide reasonable translations, although the systems are not perfect. In some specific domains, the quality may decrease. A recently proposed approach to this domain is neural machine translation. It aims at building a jointly-tuned single neural network that maximizes translation performance, a very different approach from traditional statistical machine translation. Recently proposed neural machine translation models often belong to the encoder-decoder family in which a source sentence is encoded into a fixed length vector that is, in turn, decoded to generate a translation. The present research examines the effects of different training methods on a Polish-English Machine Translation system used for medical data. The European Medicines Agency parallel text corpus was used as the basis for training of neural and statistical network-based translation systems. The main machine translation evaluation metrics have also been used in analysis of the systems. A comparison and implementation of a real-time medical translator is the main focus of our experiments.
